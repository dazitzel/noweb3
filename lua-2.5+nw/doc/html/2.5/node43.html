<P>
The whole I/O facilities have been rewritten.
We strongly encourage programmers to addapt their code
to this new version.
However, we are keeping the old version of the libraries
in the distribution,
to allow a smooth transition.
The incompatibilities between the new and the old libraries are:
<UL><LI> The format facility of function <TT><B>write</B></TT> has been supersed by
function <TT><B>format</B></TT>;
therefore this facility has been dropped.<LI> Function <TT><B>read</B></TT> now uses <I>read patterns</I> to specify
what to read;
this is incompatible with the old format options.<LI> Function <TT><B>strfind</B></TT> now accepts patterns,
so it may have a different behavior when the pattern includes
special characteres.
