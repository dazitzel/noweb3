This client is a simple lua interpreter.
It either loads and executes the files named on the command line or reads
and executes lines from stdin.
Note that, in the second case, each line must contain a complete statement.
For instance, functions cannot span several lines.

The 'lbench' client executes argv[1] as a file, using the remaining
arguments as an `arg' vector.  It is designed for benchmarking using
the conventions of Doug Bagley's `Language Shootout'.
