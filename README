This is an alpha version of Noweb 3.  Alpha versions are numbered by
date; for example, the first version to tangle and weave itself was
alpha980616.  This alpha version is being release to allow people to
play with Noweb 3 and in the hopes the Noweb users will fill in some
of the holes.


To get some idea of what is going on with Noweb 3, look at the revised
Hacker's Guide.

To build Noweb 3, you need a working Noweb 2, plus a C compiler.  See
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~nr/noweb for Noweb 2.
The distribution includes:

  lua-2.5+nw   Lua-2.5+nw, a modified Lua 2.5 (from PUC-Rio, Brasil)
  cii	       CII, from Dave Hanson, stripped down to Noweb's needs only.
  c            C source code for Noweb
  lua          Lua source code for Noweb commands and pipeline stages
  nocond       A filter to help build Noweb 3 from sources.
  xdoc         Documentation, especially the revised Hacker's Guide

Lua-2.5+nw and CII are used by permission.

To build Noweb 3:

  1) Edit lua-2.5/config according to the directions.

  2) Get nocond onto your path.

  3) Set these variables in the Makefile:
       CC         the name of an ANSI C compiler
       MAXALIGN   as is for Linux (Slackware 3.3), otherwise
		  see cii/install.html for more info (this is a wart)
     And define the following directories:
       BIN        on $PATH, will hold no
       LIB2       where Noweb 2 put markup, nt, noxref, ...
       LIB3       where Noweb 3 Lua code will go
     BIN and LIB3 are *outputs*, where noweb will place
     binaries and scripts that are customized for your installation.
     Therefore you should:
       - make sure you have write permission to these directories.
       - refrain from making them point into the noweb source distribution.
     LIB2 is an input, so version 3 can find the pieces from version 2
     that it needs to bootstrap itself.

  3bis) If you know a full pathname for test, put it in lua/config.nw

  4) Fasten your seat belt and type `make all install'.  
     The system should build with only these warnings:
       - whining about parser.c in the Lua sources
       - whining about const in c/util.nw
     It takes under two minutes on my 133MHz Linux box.

  5) You can clean up by typing `make clean', or more likely, 
     `make clobber'.

Noweb 3 uses a new style of invocation

  no weave ...
  no tangle ...

Start hacking and send in some code!  The web page has a list of what
needs to be done, but it's not complete.  If you think it's useful,
send it in.  Also, if you have questions about what is going on, send
those too, and I can use them to help me improve the documentation.

Noweb 3 would not have been possible without the efforts of Garret
Prestwood.
